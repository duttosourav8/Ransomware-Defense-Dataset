# RansomwareShield - Augmented Dataset

This repository contains the **augmented dataset** used for evaluating the **RansomwareShield** model. The dataset was created to analyze ransomware behavior through various static and dynamic features collected from a variety of **Android** and **Windows** executables.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Samples**: 62,485 (with an equal distribution of benign and malicious samples)
- **Number of Features**: 41 features
  - **Static Features**: Permissions, API usage, security flags, etc.
  - **Dynamic Features**: Runtime behavior, network activity, system calls.
  - **Target Label**: `Benign` (0) or `Malicious` (1)
